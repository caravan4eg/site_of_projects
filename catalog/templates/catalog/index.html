    <p>Welcome to LocalLibrary!</p>
    <p>Most of content is dynamically generated from data base. At LocalLibrary pages are implemented access
        restriction, generic class-based and functions based views, mixins and decorators. There is bunch of
        possibilities to work with books and authors.</p>
    <p>There are some types of users:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>user/user[jxe100dm - can look trough catalog of Library and see borrowed by him books;</li>
        <li>librarian/librarian[jxe100dm - can trough catalog of Library and see all borrowed books,
            to do CRUD for books and authors;
        </li>
        <li>developer19/dev[jxe100dm - can do everything;</li>
    </ul>

        <li><strong>Copies:</strong> {{ num_instances }}</li>
        <li><strong>Copies available:</strong> {{ num_instances_available }}</li>
        <li><strong>Authors:</strong> {{ num_authors }}</li>
