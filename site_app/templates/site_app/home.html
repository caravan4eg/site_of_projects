    <h1 class="display-4">This is Python & Django practise site</h1>
    <hr>
    <p> I looked on my son. He's well-known front-end developer and I like
        very much what he makes.
        <br/><br/>
        And I asked myself how all of these websites work?
        If I can understand it and make something as wonderful as my son makes?
        It was a warm rainy autumn day (2018) when I decided to learn backend programming with Python and Django from
        zero.

        <br/><br/>
        I would say it's my tango with Django.
        Now I'm third month on this road and I still keep going :-)
        <br/><br/>
        Here I'll try and if you want you'll see simple functions of Python and Django.
        You'll find on this site search functionality, result of interaction with
        data base, small blog and library catalog, using Django Template Language
        and something else useful but I do not know what yet ;-)
    <p><em>At <strong>Blog's</strong> pages you can see short history how is it going right now...</em></p>
    <br/><br/>
    <strong>About functionality</strong>
    <p>Site has Blog, LocalLibrary and some Study exercises.
        All posts in the Blog is getting by request from servers database.
        It can be SQLight or PostgreSQL/MySQL. It depends from server where site is running.
        Everyone can read and add posts.
        At LocalLibrary you can see function and generic class based views, access restriction,
        different permission by different group of users as result of implementing decorators and mixins.
        If you want test behavior of users use authentication form at very bottom of page
        Study Exercises show some techniques of templates in Django, content of GET Request
        and others.</p>
